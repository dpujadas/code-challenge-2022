# vpTech Code Challenge 2020

The 2020 edition of the **vpTech Code Challenge** is dedicated to **Halloween**!
The goal is simple:
You have to create a REST API
to **move a player** (_random halloween monster_)
over a random generated board,
**killing the other players** (_other halloween monsters_)
and some **common enemies** (_evil pumpkins_),
to get the **best score**.

Your API will move a player competing with the other player APIs in a real time competition.
Each player will start in a different random position.
The winner will be the player with the highest score.

* **+25 points** to kill an enemy.
* **+50 points** to kill another player.
* **-100 points** when killed by another player or enemy.

She the [full rules](docs/rules.md) or the [API documentation](docs/api.md).

## Development

### Configuration

This repo constains the server used for the **vpTech Code Challenge 2020**.
It's a [PHP](http://php.net/) project which uses the [Symfony 3.4](https://symfony.com/) framework, a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database and a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) messaging system.
It has been developed using **`PHP 7.2`**, **`MySQL 5.7`**, **`RabbitMQ 3.7`** and **[`docker`](https://www.docker.com/)** technologies.
The `docker` folder contains the particular images used in the development environment and some [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) commands with helps configurating the environment.

- `docker/build.sh` - Build the docker images.
- `docker/start.sh` - Start all the project containers.
- `docker/stop.sh` - Stop all the project containers.
- `docker/composer.sh` - Execute composer inside the container (params are allowed). The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/console.sh` - Execute a console command inside the container (params are allowed). The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/phpunit.sh` - Execute phpunit unit tests inside the container (params are allowed). The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/bash.sh` - Access bash shell of the API container. The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/su.sh` - Access bash shell of the API container with the `root`user. The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/php.sh` - Execute the php command of the API container. The containers must be started before run this script.
- `docker/mysql.sh` - Access the mysql command of the MySQL container. The containers must be started before run this script.

NOTE: All these scripts assume there is an user `david` in the host.
You can change it for your user name to avoid permission problems.

### Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vpTechOSS/code-challenge-2020.git
$ cd code-challenge-2020
$ docker/build.sh
$ docker/start.sh
$ docker/composer.sh install
$ docker/console.sh doctrine:database:create
$ docker/console.sh doctrine:schema:create
$ docker/console.sh -e prod cache:clear
$ docker/console.sh -e prod cache:warmup
```

#### Params

The following program params are suitable to use with the default docker installation:

NOTE: The following params will in the file `app/config/params.yml` after running
the `docker/composer.sh install` command.
It's mandatory to clear and warmup the cache before changing any of these params
in `prod` environment.

* MySQL database:
    * database_host: **cc18_mysql**
    * database_port: **3306**
    * database_name: **cc18_db**
    * database_user: **cc18_user**
    * database_password: **cc18_pass**

* RabbitMQ message broker:
    * rabbitmq_host: **cc18_rabbitmq**
    * rabbitmq_port: **5672**
    * rabbitmq_user: **guest**
    * rabbitmq_pass: **guest**
    * rabbitmq_vhost: **/**

* Security:
    * secret: **<super-secret-string>**
    * admin_password: **null**
    * guest_password: **null**

* Game settings:
    * default_email: **<admin@email.com>**
    * default_time_format: **Y-m-d H:i:s**
    * default_timeout: **3**
    * game_start_time: **null**
    * game_end_time: **null**
    * game_free_time: **null**

### Setting passwords

There are two special users with different privileges: `admin`and `guess`.
To set the password for any of those users you have to run a console command:

```
$ docker/console.sh security:encode-password <password>
  
  Symfony Password Encoder Utility
  ================================
  
   ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Key                Value
   ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Encoder used       Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\BCryptPasswordEncoder
    Encoded password   $2y$12$buqWDQ.ca9ICbPg9JUNvi.WJBQu8Qi5CGBauWQTTowmFphD4qEZHC
   ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
```

Then you have to copy the new password in the file `app/config/params.yml`:

```
parameters:
    (...)
    admin_password: $2y$12$buqWDQ.ca9ICbPg9JUNvi.WJBQu8Qi5CGBauWQTTowmFphD4qEZHC
    guest_password: null
```

And finally you have to clear and warmup the Symfony cache:

```
$ docker/console.sh -e prod cache:clear
$ docker/console.sh -e prod cache:warmup
```
